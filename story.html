        <p class="summary">I am a <span class="sota"> Scientist</span> with a background in Full-Stack Web Development, Art, Genomics, Proteomics and Neuroscience üß†.</p>
        <p class="summary">Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, I became fascinated with theories and mathematical axioms at a very young age. I never could quite wrap my head around the idea that the universe has a very specific nature. This dilemma fueled my passion to understand science at a very fundamental level. I found myself constantly seeking answers to questions such as, "why does the universe have constants?", "why does entropy always increase?", "what is gravity?", "are there more than four fundamental forces of nature?", "why does math have specific rules?", and so on. Soon enough, I became obsessed with trying to understand all branches of science from quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, chemistry, biology, and relativity. While on the pursuit, I began to favor neuroscience. I was interested in the functionality of the brain. I wanted to understand how independent microsystems such as neurons can scale-up to become neural networks and how the unification of those networks can simulate  conscious observation. More specifically, I was trying to understand how the process of scaling influenced a biological-system's ability to resist entropy. These questions followed with me to Sacred Heart University where I graduated with a bachelor's degree in <span class="sota"> biology.</span></p>
        <p class="summary">Currently, I am on a <span class="sota">quest </span>to discover the fundamental mechanics of intelligence</p>
        <p class="summary"><span class="sota">Part of the journey </span>I am on now is to understand and bring the new wave of <span class="sota">Deep Learning </span> to <span class="sota"> Medical Research. </span></p>
        <p class="summary summary-end">If you have read this far, you might as well spark up a conversation. <span class="smile">üòÅ</span></p>
